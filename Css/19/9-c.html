    <div id="c"> Hi there! My name is Joan Kelly, and I am a passionate shelter dog lover who firmly believes in giving every dog the loving home they deserve. I am the proud fur-mom of three amazing rescue dogs – Steve, Lexus, and Harley, my loyal and loving companions. Each of them has brought so much joy, love, and laughter into my life, and I am forever grateful for the incredible bond we share.

        As an advocate for shelter dogs, I dedicate my time to raising awareness about the importance of adoption, dispelling misconceptions about certain breeds, and supporting organizations that work tirelessly to rescue and rehabilitate dogs in need. Through my experiences, I hope to inspire others to open their hearts and homes to the countless dogs waiting for their forever families in shelters.
        
        When I’m not advocating for shelter dogs or spending quality time with my furr
        y companions, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, trying out new dog-friendly recipes, and connecting 
        with fellow dog lovers in various online communities</div>
